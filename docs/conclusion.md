This lab showed how to install, configure, and strengthen an Ubuntu Server LTS virtual machine using QEMU and virt-manager. The goal was to create a clean, simple system that is suitable for real-world system administration tasks and cybersecurity best practices.

We walked through:

- Manual partitioning during installation
- Initial login and system updates
- SSH key generation and key-based access
- Basic service management and tool installation
- Disabling password authentication for SSH
- Enabling and configuring the UFW firewall

These steps create the basis for a secure Linux environment. This virtual machine is simple and meant for lab use. However, the concepts here can easily apply to production and enterprise systems.

This lab is part of a wider collection that highlights practical skills in Linux system administration, secure setup, and professional documentation. It shows knowledge of both system configuration and security practices, without using automated tools or scripts.

For future labs, this project can act as a starting point or template for developing more complex services, like web hosting, monitoring, or intrusion detection. It also shows readiness for junior-level positions in system administration, IT operations, or cybersecurity.

End of lab.
