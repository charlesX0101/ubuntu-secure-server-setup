# Introduction

This lab project shows how to set up and strengthen a virtual Ubuntu Server LTS system. The aim is to showcase basic skills required of a junior systems administrator or cybersecurity analyst. This includes manual partitioning, configuring secure SSH access, and setting up a firewall using UFW.

The system is set up in a QEMU virtual machine on a Pop!_OS workstation. It simulates a production-style workflow that focuses on clarity, repeatability, and security.

## Objectives

- Perform a clean Ubuntu Server LTS installation with manual partitioning
- Configure static IP networking
- Set up secure SSH access using key-based authentication
- Harden the SSH daemon configuration
- Enable and verify firewall rules using UFW
- Document the process with organized screenshots and configs

This lab serves both as a practical demonstration of hands-on skills and as a public portfolio entry for recruiters and hiring managers.

## Target Audience

- Junior Sysadmin candidates
- Entry-level SOC analysts
- Students preparing for real-world Linux administration
- Anyone building a GitHub lab portfolio

## Environment

- Host OS: Pop!_OS (QEMU/KVM environment)
- Guest OS: Ubuntu Server LTS
- Tools used: QEMU/KVM, OpenSSH, UFW, Fastfetch

All setup and configuration steps are done manually, without automated scripts. This approach helps to show individual skills and understanding of the system.
